But are we investing enough?  via @nytimes Last year we issued a call to reinvent the toilet. Now we’re issuing one specifically for #India:  This is a cool new visualization of shipping routes. I read a great book about this recently:   The battle against #AIDS is not over. But number of people dying continues to decline. How was this achieved? Read:  What will happen to Earth’s temperature in your lifetime? This guide from the @guardian explains:  #climatechange Lots of interest in my comments last week about Ctrl+Alt+Del. Watch the rest of my chat:  \"The world of extreme poverty and disease may now finally be on its way out.\" Great column by @NickKristof:  At a glance: the best #MDG performers in sub-Saharan Africa.  I love this chart. It says we can stop 49 million deaths in 15 years. #MDGs   On our last day at the U.N., @melindagates and I did a bit of stumping. Here’s why:  My wish list for the next round of #MDGs. It’s just four things…  Waiting to address UN special event on #MDGs. Nice camera work, @melindagates.   Here’s my wrap-up of day 2 in NYC. Got to see leaders from #Chad, #Pakistan, and much more:  Don’t feel bad if you can’t name all 8 #MDGs. Just consult this primer:  Just posted a wrap-up of the first day of U.N. Week. What a way to start the week…  Great stat from meeting President Goodluck Jonathan: Polio in #Nigeria is down 50% from last year. More on our talk  A @billclinton selfie from #CGI2013 as we sat down to talk for an upcoming @WIRED story.  The UK just pledged another £1 billion to fighting AIDS, TB, and malaria. What a great example for other donors.  We won’t hit all #MDGs by 2015 but millions of children\\'s lives have been saved. I dare anyone to call that failure:  Everyone should know about the #MDGs, 8 goals that have revolutionized the fight against poverty. A good primer:  At first I had reservations, but I came to love the Millennium Development Goals. Here’s why:  #MDGs News gets better on meningits. 94% drop in all forms of the disease due to vaccination:  In 5 years, the number of #Kenyans living with #AIDS has dropped by 200K. Here\\'s why:  It’s really hard to track the spread of drug-resistant #malaria. A new fast test may help:  “Let’s celebrate this new world record in the most important category there is.” @melindagates  When you see the term “global health,” think “saving lives.” That’s what it means. | @nytimes:  Progress towards the MDGs has been impressive. Are we ready to take the next step? @JeffDSachs weighs in:  850 days left, and still much work left to reach the MDGs… How do we speed up progress for the world’s poorest?

A: 17%   How much of the Earth are humans consuming? It’s a huge question. My favorite author tried to answer it:  His books are complex, but @VaclavSmil is one of my favorite writers.
